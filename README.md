**Warning:** This module is currently unusable! I just prefer using version
management while developing. Once a usable version is ready, I will submit
it to Hackage.

== Introduction

This module will provide a binding for liblbfgs, an implementation of
Limited memory BFGS (a method for solving nonlinear optimization problems).
